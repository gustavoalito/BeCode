# GDPR - Introduction

Type of challenge: **learning** </br>
Duration: **1 day** </br>
Team Challenge: **group**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* be more aware of the what is exactly the GDPR
* identify a personal data
* evaluate the protection required for a given data

## The mission

In the past years, we saw the internet conquer the world. New business models were born based on the data harvesting and resell for advertising purposes. Without any regulations, there has been many cases of user's data abuse, and of user's data mis-protection/mis-handling (not using strong enough means to protect it). In order to protect citizens, the European Commission wrote the Global Data Protection Regulation. Your mission, will be to understand which data we should protect and how.

Instructions:

* get together with your team, and discuss the following subject trying to make a definition a private data :
    * what is a private data ?
    * how to identify a private data ?
    * would any private data be more important than others ?
* once each group has its own definition, we will get all together in the boardroom to make one common definition.
* once everybody is aligned with the same definition of private data, you will discuss, in each group, the following subject :
    - what is data processing? Why is it important to define the data processing you apply?
    - what should you do in case of a data breach? Are all data breach equals?
* and we will get all together one last time to discuss the last questions.
