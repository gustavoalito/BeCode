## Local Development Server

When we work on a project, we don't work directly on the machine that will serve the files of the website or application, because the slightest typo mistake would look bad and hurt the client's brand image (at the very least).

So we develop on our own PC ("development environment"), until the files are ready for production (we then put them on the "production environment").

### How to setup a local development environment ?(mandatory)

To develop in PHP, you need to install the PHP software.
To develop in MySQL, you need to install the PHP software. But you actually need a third software to use PHP (and MySQL): a Web server.

The most common stacks are LAMP and LEMP : Linux + Apache (or nginx, pronounced "Engine X") + MySQL + PHP.

You can also find a Windows alternative: WAMP. I'll let you guess what the Mac OS X version's name is...

Feel free to setup apache, MySQL and PHP directly on your machine.

- [LAMP on Linux](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/lamp)
- [PHPMyAdmin](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/phpmyadmin)

If you are on linux or windows you can also use [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/), it's easy to set up your server...

## Docker ?(Optional)

 [Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/) is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.
