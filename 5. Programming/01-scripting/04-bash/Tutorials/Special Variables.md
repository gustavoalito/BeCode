In the tutorial about shell functions, we use "$1" to represent the first argument passed to function_A. Moreover, here are some special variables in shell:

$0 - The filename of the current script.|
$n - The Nth argument passed to script was invoked or function was called.|
$# - The number of argument passed to script or function.|
$@ - All arguments passed to script or function.|
$* - All arguments passed to script or function.|
$? - The exit status of the last command executed.|
$$ - The process ID of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.|
$! - The process number of the last background command.|

Example in file **special_variables.sh**.
