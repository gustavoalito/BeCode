# Process Substitution

In the previous section we've seen how to chain output of one command to the next one. But what if you want to chain the output of two or more commands to the another one? What if you have a command that takes a file as argument but you would like to process whatever is send to that file?

Process substitution allows a processâ€™s input or output to be referred to using a filename. It has two forms: output <(cmd), and input >(cmd).

## Examples

### Output

Imagine you've two files for which you want to compare the content. Using diff file1 file2 could generate false positives in the case lines are not ordered. So if you want to compare those files you could create two new files, ordered, and compare those. It would look like:

`sort file1 > sorted_file1`
`sort file2 > sorted_file2`
`diff sorted_file1 sorted_file2`

With process substitution you can do it in one line:

`diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2)`

### Input

Imagine you want to store logs of an application into a file and at the same time print it on the console. A very handy command for that is tee.

`echo "Hello, world!" | tee /tmp/hello.txt`

Now let say you want to have only lower case characters in the file but keep the regular case on the output. You could use process substitution that way:

`echo "Hello, world!" | tee >(tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' > /tmp/hello.txt)`

- `tee` is a command that reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files simultaneously.
- `>()` is a process substitution construct in Bash. It allows you to treat the output of a command as a file descriptor, effectively creating a temporary file or pipeline that can be used as an argument to another command.
- `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` is a command that performs character translation. In this case, it transforms uppercase letters to lowercase letters.

The tee command duplicates the input stream. One copy goes to the standard output (usually the terminal), displaying "Hello, world!" as expected. The other copy is sent to the process substitution >(tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' > /tmp/hello.txt).

Inside the process substitution:

The tr command converts any uppercase letters in the input stream to lowercase letters.
The output of the tr command is redirected (>) to the file /tmp/hello.txt.
As a result, after running this script, you'll see "Hello, world!" printed on the screen. Additionally, the lowercase version of the same text will be stored in the file /tmp/hello.txt.

In summary, this script prints a message, converts the message to lowercase, and saves the lowercase version to a file. The use of process substitution and redirection allows for these operations to be performed simultaneously.
