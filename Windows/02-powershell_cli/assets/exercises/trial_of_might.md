Now that you gathered some basic understanding of the Powershell CLI, here is an exercise to test your might! It's been put together by the guys at [UnderTheWire](https://underthewire.tech/) (_very similar to OverTheWire_).

- Go to the webpage of the [Century game](https://underthewire.tech/century) and follow the instructions there
- **complete a maximum amount of levels** and **take note of the passwords** for each one of them
- First level:  ```century1@century.underthewire.tech``` 
- Password: ```century1```
- Encrypt the collected passwords with GPG, upload them on GitHub with a minimalist readme, and send me your public key.
