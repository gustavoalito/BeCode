# Exercise Powershell CLI - Trial of might

Now that you gathered some basic understanding of the Powershell CLI, here is an exercise to test your might! It's been put together by the guys at [UnderTheWire](https://underthewire.tech/) (_very similar to OverTheWire_). You will have to tackle a series of exercise called Century that is aimed at testing the fundamentals of Powershell know-hows.

- Go to the webpage of the [Century game](https://underthewire.tech/century) and follow the instructions there
- **complete a maximum amount of levels** and **take note of the passwords** for each one of them

The link to the slack is wrong in the century page, the correct link is this : https://communityinviter.com/apps/underthewire/underthewire
