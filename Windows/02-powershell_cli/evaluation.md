# Evaluation Criteria

This document lists criteria that **evaluate** your success in developing the **competency** associated with the given challenge. In other words, it's an evaluation guideline. It can be used by you or someone else (_coach_, _coworker_, _etc..._) and paired with a **grading system** (ex: _"I"nsufficient_, _"S"ufficient_, _"G"ood_) to have a clear assessment of each criteria.

| Criteria          | Indicator                                                         | Subjectivity |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| **Relevance**     | Learned enough of the Linux CLI to tackle the "_Trial of Might_". | low          |
| _Completeness_    | Has completed each one of the given exercise in its integrity.    | medium       |

The headers for the table above can be summarized as follow:

- **Criteria**: a measurable benchmark to analyze a competency development.
- **Indicator**: the observable elements that indicates if a criteria has been meet or not. 
- **Subjectivity**: the estimated level of personal opinion required to judge an indicator success ("_low_", "_medium_" or "_high_").

> **NOTE**: Criteria can be either a "**must have**" or a "_nice to have_" depending on their importance in regards to the competency.
