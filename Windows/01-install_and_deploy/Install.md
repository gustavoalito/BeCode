## The Mission
You work as a computer technician for the company VeryEasyIT. You are asked to install Windows for one of their clients. 
Now this is something you've never done before, but you know you'll find the resources on the internet to accomplish your task.  

On this computer, there will be two users. 
1. Alice will be the administrator of the system. 
2. Bob, who is a user with restricted access. 
He can only read, write and execute files in his ``/Users/Bob`` folder.

As it is a windows system, don't forget to **install/configure an antivirus and a firewall.**
