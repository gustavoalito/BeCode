# Challenge

- Bob has a dog (a bull terrier) named "Shimi". Bob really loves his dog. 
- Alice is a fan of MÃ©canique. She has two vintage cars and often likes to parade around with her ancestral objects.
- Your mission will be to obtain Alice's or Bob's password

## Bob

I will focus on Bob's use case since for Alice it would be the same principle, just a change in the page she would visit to register/log in. 

The initial idea was to create a landing page inviting Bull Terrier lovers to register via their Google account. 

It would look something like this:

The idea was to add the Google login form at the bottom right corner of the page. However, for simplicity reasons, I decided to only create the form. Why is that? Well, the phishing campaign idea would be to:

1. Send a phishing email inviting Bull Terrier lovers to join the website by clicking the provided link.
2. The link would take the users to the Google log in page.
3. Once the users enter their credentials, they would be harvested and send the user back to Google's log in page.
