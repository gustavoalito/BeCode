# Samba enumeration 

## What is a Samba server?
A Samba server is characterized as such when a suite of free software is used to share resources between systems that are incompatible by nature. The GNU General Public License allows the implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which gave the name to the Samba suite, in the Linux and Unix operating systems.  This resource sharing protocol (SMB), also known in its more recent version as CIFS for Common Internet File System, was originally used as a Windows local area network to establish interactions with file servers, printers and other services. With such an implementation computers under Windows, Linux and Unix can be connected so that they can exchange data or jointly use printers and other services. It doesn't matter whether the server is installed under Linux or Unix, because the fourth version of the software supports the role of Active Directory Domain Controllers, through which a central authorization and authentication of individual computers and users is possible.
