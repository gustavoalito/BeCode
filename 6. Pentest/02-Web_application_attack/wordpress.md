## What is Wordpress  
WordPress is a free, open-source content management system (CMS). This software written in PHP is based on a MySQL database and is distributed by the WordPress.org foundation. The functionalities of WordPress allow it to create and manage different types of websites: showcase site, online sales site, application site, blog, portfolio, institutional site, teaching site...

It is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 license. The software is also used as the basis for the WordPress.com multi-site service, which supports several million sites.

43% of the Web is powered by WordPress. More bloggers, small businesses and Fortune 500 companies use WordPress than all other options combined.

## Site Management and Administration
WordPress is a content management system designed to be installed locally on one's personal computer, on an office computer or on an intranet. Through its own web server or shared hosting, it is possible to access and modify the content of the website at any time.

Installation and updates of WordPress are quick and easy.

The website can be managed and administered by several users, each of whom can create a profile by entering several pieces of information. It is possible to restrict the possibility of creating and modifying content for a user by managing his access rights:

- **Administrator**: has access to all the features of the WordPress administration, this profile is created automatically during the installation of WordPress;
- **Editor**: can publish and manage his own pages as well as those of other users;
- **Author**: can only publish and manage their own posts;
- **Contributor**: can write and manage his own articles, but cannot publish them;
- **Subscriber**: can only manage their profile and information.
