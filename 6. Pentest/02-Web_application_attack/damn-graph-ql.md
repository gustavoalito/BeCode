# About DVGA
Damn Vulnerable GraphQL is a deliberately weak and insecure implementation of GraphQL that provides a safe environment to attack a GraphQL application, allowing developers and IT professionals to test for vulnerabilities.

## DVGA Operation Support
- Queries
- Mutations
- Subscriptions

DVGA has numerous flaws, such as Injections, Code Executions, Bypasses, Denial of Service, and more. See the full list under the [Scenarios](#scenarios) section.

# Operation Modes
DVGA supports Beginner and Expert level game modes, which will change the exploitation difficulty.

# Tutorial

Here's a nice [tutorial](https://zerodayhacker.com/dvga-walkthrough/) about GraphQL. 

To install it on Kali Linux, follow this [link instead](https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/installing-docker-on-kali/).

To install **Inql** as an extension of Bur Suite, follow this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhKBV_iem0) or simply install it to use in the terminal `pip install inql`.
