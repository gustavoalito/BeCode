# AI-Stellar pentest
- Group : Solo
- Delay : 2 Days

## Context Project
You will need to perform a penetration test on an AI Stellar server. The test can only be performed on a server with the IP address listed below.

The following actions are prohibited:

- IP Spoofing
- DDOS attack
- Pivoting

## Deliverables
You need to write a step-by-step report of the methods you used to compromise the machine. 

### Reporting
Reports are often considered a necessary evil of penetration testing. Unfortunately, many highly technical and intelligent penetration testers don't give them the attention they deserve, but a well-written, professional-looking report can sometimes get more attention than its poorly written but technically competent counterpart.

Still, a penetration test without a detailed report is a worthless test. The report should allow your client to reproduce the steps you took and should be able to correct the problems. 

Even if you are not the one who will fix the flaws and vulnerabilities, you must also make a proposal to mitigate the problems encountered.

### Think about the audience
Think about who will read and act on the information you have included in the report. What does your audience hope to learn from it? Who are they? In most cases, people with very different technical backgrounds will read your report. Try to write something that satisfies each potential reader of the report. 

In practice, this means writing your report in sections that meet the needs of different audiences. You can expect that senior executives of a company will read certain parts of the report. In most cases, these executives do not have the time or inclination to read all the highly technical details of the attack. That's why most reports begin with a summary. The summary should be a short (no more than two pages), high-level explanation of the results and the client's overall security posture.Since this is probably the only part they will read, be sure to tailor this section and the language used. There will also be a team of more technical professionals who will read your report in more detail. The rest of the report should be directed to them, and include all the gory details of the carnage you inflicted on the company.

### Think about what to include
Specifically, it's helpful to think about what not to include. Keep in mind that your readers will want to address the issues you've uncovered, so any content you include should be relevant and meaningful. A report bloated with too much tangential or irrelevant information only makes it difficult for your audience to read and understand. Don't include filler material just to make the report seem longer.

Here are four quick tips on what to include and what to leave out:

1. DO NOT include pages and pages of results from a tool in your report unless it is absolutely relevant. Consider the output from Nmap. There is no reason for you to include every line of the tool's output in your report, as it adds nothing of value. If you have a point you are trying to make, such as a very high number of exposed SNMP services on publicly accessible hosts, then use the -oG flag and extract only those hosts with SNMP ports.

2. Use screenshots wisely. The same rule applies to the rest of the content you add to your report. Use a screenshot to illustrate your point, not just to show impressive meterpreter output.  For example, let's say you have obtained root access on a Linux host. Rather than showing 15 screenshots of various directory listings that only a root user can access, simply include a single screenshot of the output of the whoami command. An informed reader may only need this one thing to understand what you have done.

3. Include additional documents as additional supporting documentation. If you have content that is on the page but will not be interesting to your overall audience, consider providing additional supporting documents in addition to the report. Readers who need the information will still be able to access the supporting documents and the quality of the report will not be affected.

4. Perhaps the most important thing is to refer to the purpose of the evaluation. Think about what you are trying to say in relation to the purpose and how each piece of information will or will not reinforce that point.
