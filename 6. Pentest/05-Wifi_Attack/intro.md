# Wifi attack

## What is a Wifi network penetration test?
Before the advent of Wi-Fi, hackers had two types of computer attacks at their disposal. They could either use an external attack, via the Internet, or an internal attack, by accessing the company's internal network through a malicious person or a ruse.

Thanks to wireless, a hacker can access the network without having to enter the premises. Wireless network pentesting consists in searching for vulnerabilities in the entire wireless infrastructure of the company. Whether it is a simple "box" or a complex configuration, the Wifi penetration test will highlight possible weaknesses in the system that could be exploited by a malicious person.

## Why a Wifi network pentest?
The Wifi network opens an additional door to the hacker. While the wired network "stops" at the walls of the company and is not accessible from outside, the Wi-Fi network can be visible outside the company. Depending on the power, positioning and configuration of the wireless network equipment, it is possible to detect a company's Wi-Fi network by standing close enough, while remaining outside. The hacker does not need to have physical access to the company, he just needs to be able to stand close enough. This can be complicated in a factory surrounded by a large security perimeter, but particularly easy in an office building shared by several companies or a health care facility, for example.

An insufficiently secured wireless network can allow a hacker to connect to the corporate network. Once inside the system, it will be possible to take advantage of other vulnerabilities, inherent to the hardware and software deployed and accessible on the network. Sensitive data is thus no longer safe.

## How does a Wifi network intrusion test work?
The different equipments used, connected to each other, and their configurations will be analyzed in order to map the networks. Those which could potentially be accessible from outside the building will be identified. Access points will also be identified and their SSIDs masked.

Until a few years ago, a WEP key was enough to secure a wireless access point. Now, it only takes a few minutes to break this type of key. The WPA and especially WPA2 protocols are more secure, but are not always sufficient. Dictionary and brute force attacks will be performed to break these keys. The Wifi networks will be listed and analyzed, as well as the technologies used to secure them. The weakest protocol will be selected as it will represent a potential risk for all other networks.

A wireless network intrusion test generally lasts between five and ten days depending on the perimeter to be checked. It can be performed in black box (the company's teams are not aware that a security test is in progress, the tests are performed from outside) or in grey box (the auditor has a classic user account on the network).

## What to do after the Wifi intrusion test ?
At the end of the test, a complete report is written, including a complete mapping of the Wifi networks. A summary of the security flaws detected is presented with their detailed characteristics.

Each detected vulnerability is also the subject of a detailed technical sheet. It is classified according to its importance. The operations to be performed to reproduce and correct the security problem are also detailed.

Recommendations are also provided in order to implement a longer term cybersecurity policy. Taking these recommendations into account and implementing the recommended security measures is then the responsibility of the company.

However, it is recommended to perform a Wifi network intrusion test on a regular basis. It will be possible to verify that new vulnerabilities have not appeared and that the equipment, hardware and software, is always correctly configured and that the latest updates have been applied.
