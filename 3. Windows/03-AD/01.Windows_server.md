You work as a computer technician for the company VeryEasyIT. You are asked to install Windows server 2016 for one of their clients. 
Now this is something you've never done before, but you know you'll find the resources on the internet to accomplish your task.  

On this computer, there will be two users. 
1. Alice will be the administrator of the system. 
2. Bob, who is a user with restricted access. 
He can only read, write and execute files in his ``/Users/Bob`` folder.
3. Some network services will have to be shared between users.
4. You must configure an IIS web server 
5. You must configure a DNS server
6. You must configure a DHCP server
7. Install LDAP
8. Securise your AD


As it is a windows system, don't forget to **install/configure an antivirus and a firewall.**
