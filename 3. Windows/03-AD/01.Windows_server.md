On this computer, there will be two users. 
1. Alice will be the administrator of the system. 
2. Bob, who is a user with restricted access. 
He can only read, write and execute files in his ``/Users/Bob`` folder.
3. Some network services will have to be shared between users.
4. You must configure an IIS web server 
5. You must configure a DNS server
6. You must configure a DHCP server
