On this computer, there will be two users. 
1. Alice will be the administrator of the system. 
2. Bob, who is a user with restricted access. 
He can only read, write and execute files in his ``/Users/Bob`` folder.
3. Some network services will have to be shared between users.
4. You must configure an IIS web server
5. You must configure an DNS server
6. You must configure an DHCP server
