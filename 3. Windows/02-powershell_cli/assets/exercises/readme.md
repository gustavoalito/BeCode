This page holds the exercises necessary to have a basic knowledge of PowerShell.

After following them all, the last step, a challenge, was the [Trial of might](https://github.com/gustavoalito/BeCode/blob/main/Windows/02-powershell_cli/assets/exercises/trial_of_might.md).

This challenge takes us to the page *underthewire.tech* where we will follow the "Century" challenge to find 15 passwords. The aim is to find the next level's password by completing a given task. 

You'll find attached to this page the encrypted file containing all this challenge's passwords: [underthewire_century.pgp](https://github.com/gustavoalito/BeCode/blob/main/Windows/02-powershell_cli/assets/exercises/underthewire_century.gpg).

Since this is encrypted, only interested (and authorized) people will have my public key to decrypt it.
