Type of challenge: **learning** </br>
Competency: **is able to recognise good security practices on a computer** </br>
Duration: **half a day** </br>
Team challenge : **solo**

## The mission

Have you ever been told that a good hygiene is important to avoid sickness? Well computers are much the same. If they are not well taken care of, they can catch viruses! This briefing will have you explore some of the **good practices** that constitute a sane **cyber hygiene**.

To do so **complete** this [quizz](https://www.isdecisions.com/user-security-awareness-game/) on your own, while **taking note** of what you learn along the way. Then do some more research about [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager), [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29), [password strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength) and [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing). 

To guide you through your research try to answer the following questions:

- What makes a password strong?
- What are three good reasons to use a password manager?
- What's a "_passwordless_" approach to security? What are its advantages?
- What's phising and how to prevent it?
- How could one prevent social engineering?
- What are five bad practices when it comes to digital security?
- What constitutes, in your opinion, a good cyber hygiene?

> **NOTE**: We'll all get back together **to discuss your answers**, **findings** and **opinions** at the end of the challenge.

## Congrats

There is far more to **cyber hygiene** than what has been seen during this briefing, but hopefully it will have opened your mind to the fact that **you are the primary actor** of your digital security and although you cannot prevent all risks, **being informed** is a first step. In other words, stay informed, stay clean, stay safe, be happy!
